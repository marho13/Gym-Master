# Gym-Master
The code used to run the PPO, DDPG and DQN algorithms in the carracing-v0 environments.
Small changes have to be made in order to run the road detection algorithm, this can be seen in the DQN folders runner.py file
Please take note that this code is meant for my personal use, and to show what i've coded for my masters, so annotation is sparse if any
